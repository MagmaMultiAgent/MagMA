# VigIL - Lux AI Competition

This repository contains a thesis research exploring **AI-based Game Validation**, along with a partial submission and template for the second edition of the annual **NeurIPS** conference in 2023.

The **Lux AI Challenge** is a competition where competitors design agents to tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors. In addition to optimization, successful agents must be capable of analyzing their opponents and developing appropriate policies to get the upper hand.



# Getting Started

I highly recommend utilizing Docker to set up and manage the environment on your system. Alternatively, a binary installation is also a viable option, especially considering the excellent performance and reliability of the official [pip](https://pypi.org/project/luxai-s2/) package.


# Core Contributors

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to [Gulyás László](https://github.com/lesIII) for their invaluable guidance and insightful mentorship throughout the course of this project.

I am also thankful to **Eötvös Lóránd University** for providing the necessary resources and environment that facilitated the development of this project.
