\chapter{Work Distribution}
\label{appx:workdistrib}

\noindent The distribution of the work presented in this research can be concisely summarized by the structure outlined here. The contributions of \textbdd{Takács Tamás} to this work include the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Created the single-unit testbench code and implemented the training and evaluation code for all algorithms (\autoref{sec:single-unit-testbench}).

\item Implemented the code and evaluated the results for the monolithic approach (\autoref{sec:monolithic-approach}).

\item Conducted ablation studies on the finalized hybrid model (\autoref{subsec:ablation}). Outlined the feature extractor structure.

\item Wrote the Introduction chapter (\autoref{ch:intro}) and the Single-Unit Testbench (\autoref{sec:single-unit-testbench}) and Monolithic Approach (\autoref{sec:monolithic-approach}) sections in the Methods chapter of this work. Additionally, he authored the following discussions: (\autoref{ch:disc-diverse-domains}; \autoref{ch:disc-dictatorship-failure}; \autoref{ch:disc-singular-to-spectrum}).

\end{itemize}

\noindent The contributions of \textbdd{Magyar Gergely} to this work include the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Greatly optimized the implementation in terms of memory usage and speed, enabling it to fit into a smaller GPU than originally required by the baseline (\autoref{subsec:comparison}).

\item Theorized and developed the method of trajectory separation (\autoref{subsec:grouping}).

\item Conducted the experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of trajectory separation (\autoref{sec:trajectory-separation}; \autoref{subsec:methodcomp}; \autoref{subsubsec:rewardass}). 

\item Wrote the Multi-Agent Environment (\autoref{sec:multi-agent-environment}) and Hybrid sections (\autoref{sec:hybrid-approach}) within the Methods chapter of this work, authored the entire Results section (\autoref{ch:resu}), and contributed to the following discussions: (\autoref{ch:disc-beyond-one-mind}; \autoref{ch:disc-init-is-all-you-need}; \autoref{ch:disc-paying-for-performance}).

\end{itemize}

\noindent All work mentioned above is \textbdd{subject to collaborative influence}, as most tasks, decision-making, testing, and writing were carried out collaboratively rather than individually. The contribution list outlined above is a close generalization.
